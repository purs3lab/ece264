There will be approximately one programming
assignment per week. Some of these assignments will be simple and test one or two
basic concepts, while other assignments will be more complicated and may require
writing a substantial amount of code. The amount of time allocated for each assignment
and the weight that assignment will carry in your final grade will account for these
differences.

**All programming assignments should be done individually.**

## ECE264 Uses Linux  
This course uses Linux.
Engineering Computer Networks (ECN, https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECN) is the IT (Information Technology) for Purdue's College of Engineering. 
ECN manages many Linux computers. Your submitted assignments will be graded on ECN Linux. 
You are strongly encouraged to write and test your programs on ECN Linux computers.
The only way to grade your submissions is to use ECN Linux. For privacy and security, the teaching staff cannot touch your computer.
The teaching staff cannot grade your programs on your computer.
Thus, please do not say, "My program runs on my computer." This statement is irrelevant.


The first homework (HW01) will explain how to use Linux computers. 
If you have no ECN account, please contact ECN. Please **do not ask the instructor**. 
The instructor is not authorized to create ECN account.
If you ask the instructor, the response is "Please ask ECN".

You must not use Windows, MacOS, Android, or any other operating systems.
Even though your C programs should work if you follow the C language standards, developing your C programs outside Linux may create unnecessary trouble.

## Getting access to the assignments

Programming assignments will be submitted via [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com).
As such, **you are required to have a GitHub account**.
This can be obtained for free at [GitHub](https://github.com).

**Important: Please submit your GitHub username along with other details in this [Classroom form](https://forms.gle/afjQoHubsh67GKA1A) by Friday, January 13th.**

We will add you to the Github classroom and from which you can access your homeworks.
