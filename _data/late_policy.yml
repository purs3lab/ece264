policies:
  - Except for medical and family emergencies (accompanied by
    verification), there will be no individual extensions granted for programming
    assignments. Late submissions will be scaled according to lateness, docking 10% from
    your score per day late, up to a maximum of 50%. Submissions more than 5 days late
    will be assigned a score of 0.
  - For instance, if you are late by 2 days (i.e., 25-48 hours), you will be penalized 20%.
    if you score is 90, then your final score after penalty will be 90 - (20% of 90) = 90 - 18 = 72
